## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Archit-175/Deep-Learning.git
cd Deep-Learning
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
